# Notes

## Syntax

All terminal characters are shown bare,
nonterminals are delimited in /Slashes/
I also use <Angled brackets>+ as grouping.
When something is followed by a
: + it appears one or more times
: * it appears zero to N times
: ? it appears zero or one time

## Newline handling

The Newline handling is a bit wonky: Mostly, only Newlines followed by
a token starting at the first column are of meaning, but inside expressions
they are important.

Getting rid of meaningless newline tokens is extremly useful for parsing,
but we need to know when to do so. What I did to handle them is that:

* Have a "pre-parse" phase dividing the token stream in N top level
  declarations (divide on N0).

* Depending on which part of the source file we are processing, simply
  remove the non-toplevel newlines and then feed the token stream into
  the pertinent parser.

* When we know the given toplevel declaration contains an expression, keep
  the newline tokens when feeding them to the parser.

## Lazy parsing

To avoid needless computation (parsing expressions or type declaration), I
(plan to) only parse subsets of declarations and stock the remaining tokens
in a data structure so I can parse them later if needed.
